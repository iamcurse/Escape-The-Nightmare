Floor - Where player can walk on.
Floor Top 1 - Just for decorating the floor.
Floor Top 2 - 2nd Layer for decorating the floor.
Ground Item - Put stuff on the floor such as "Skull", "Bottle". Players can still walk on top of this layer.
Wall - Put a layer on top of the wall (Not wall decorating).
Objects Collision - The object player cannot walk past it, such as "Box", "Table".
Objects Top - If Objects Collision object is 2 blocks high, put the second block (Top piece) on the layer. The player can walk on this grid but the player will render behind this. Such as "The top part of stacking box"
